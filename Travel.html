			<h2>United States of America</h2>
			<p>I want to visit the USA because it has many attractions and famous landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, Grand Canyon, and others. I want to visit the museums and parks too!<br><br>

			<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
			<p>When I was a child, I was curious about the Big Ben because it is described as a big clock. I want to see how big it is in real life. The red telephone booths are also interesting. Nowadays, I rarely see telephone booths here in the Philippines.  <br><br>
			
			The cities and towns look vibrant and has a culture of its own. I want to enjoy each culture, art, music, and the nightlife.</p>
